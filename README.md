# For the grader:
In this directory there's a sample solution for the `load_balancer.py` code and a sample solution for the `lab_topology.py` code as well. Students may provide different solutions for that. 

Right now, since there's only one sample solution, I kept the bash script more static, so it only checks the `load_balancer.py` and `lab_topology.py` in this directory, but as we scale this to include the students scripts, minor adaptations will have to be made to match how `Learn` outputs the files per student/group.

Script was coded in `bash`, so you either run as `bash grading_script.sh` or `./grading_script.sh`, don't use `sh grading_script`.
